4:This tool aims to make emulating realistic clicking easy. To get started you need to choose your keybinds for the tool. This can be done in the second tab labeled "Controls".\n\n\tIn the Controls tab there are buttons that show the current keybind for different actions. To bind a key to an action, click the button and press a key.\n\tThe first action is "Stat Recording". Once bound, press the key on your keyboard and begin clicking. This activates a recording session where your clicks are read and analyzed. Pressing the key again will end the session and your settings will be updated to match your own personal clicking data.\n\tThe second action is "Toggle Clicker". Once bound, press the key on your keyboard and the program will begin clicking according to the current settings. Pressing the key again will end the automated clicking.\n\tThe third action is "Toggle GUI". Once bound, press the key on your keyboard and the program will dissapear. Pressing the key again will restore the program to view.\n\n\tThe next tab is "Settings" where you can hand-tweak different values of the auto-clicker.\n\tFirstly there are four sliders. One for the minimum click delay, the maximum click delay, the average delay, and the deviation of the delay. The minimum and maximum act as bounds for the delay between clicks. The average is where most delays will reside around. The deviation determines how strongly delays will be off from the average. Higher deviation means more erradic clicking. Lower deviation means more consistent clicking.\n\tThe next setting is "Targeted Window". If the checkbox is selected the auto-clicker will only click if the window title of the program currently in use matches a given text. A list of program titles are generated when the auto-clicker opens.\n\n\tThe next tab is "Statistics". This tab shows the most recent results of your statistical recording.
